Data Analysis and Visualization of Data Breach from 2004 to 2021

This is a dataset containing all the major data breaches in the world from 2004 to 2021

As we know, there is a big issue related to the privacy of our data. Many major companies in the world still to this day face this issue every single day. Even with a great team of people working on their security, many still suffer.
In order to tackle this situation, it is only right that we must study this issue in great depth and therefore I did data analysis on this dataset.

This data contains 5 columns:

Entity: The name of the company, organization or institute
Year: In what year did the data breach took place
Records: How many records were compromised (can include information like email, passwords etc.)
Organization type: Which sector does the organization belong to
Method: Was it hacked? Were the files lost? Was it an inside job?
